# Sentiment-analysis-on-r-Wallstreetbets
This research focuses on analyzing the sentiment of Wallstreetbets submissions and investigating the potential for constructing a high-frequency trading strategy based on the sentiment information. The study involves scraping and analyzing the submissions of the last year about S&P500 firms. The sentiment analysis is conducted using three different models: TextBlob, VADER, and BERT. These models provide insights into the sentiment polarity of the submissions, ranging from positive to negative. To explore the predictive power of the sentiment information we constructed a high-frequency trading strategy. The strategy leverages the sentiment scores derived from the sentiment analysis models to make trading decisions. The performance of the strategy is evaluated, and its profitability is assessed. The findings indicate that there is some potential in using sentiment information from Wallstreetbets submissions for constructing a high-frequency trading strategy. Although, the strategies show results only when considering high-frequency trading (daily) which is exposed to high transaction costs
